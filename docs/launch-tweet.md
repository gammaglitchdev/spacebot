## Draft 1 (Original)

This is my take on the perfect AI assistant.

Written in Rust, a heavily multithreaded agentic operating system designed to scale for large Slack and Discord communities.

Meet Spacebot 🟣

The biggest issue with OpenClaw is when it's working it can't talk to you. Spacebot channels cannot use tools except to spawn branches for memory recall and thought, and workers for long running tasks.

One click to set up, dump your memory files, notes, documents and chat histories into a folder, Spacebot will turn them into structured memories automatically. It supports your existing skills, has cron, browser use and a gorgeous control UI, of course.

With built in @OpenCode support, never before have you seen a system so efficient at collaboration. I spent days making my OpenClaw bot perfect but felt limited by its lack of structure. A system like this should be opinionated but still flexible.

The cortex thread oversees the whole system, auditing memories, actioning goals and todos. You customize your Spacebot by talking to it, no config or markdown, just structure and speed.

It's foolproof to set up self hosted and there's even a one click cloud deployment at spacebot.sh

It's an absolute powerhouse, and with all the right long term design choices from the start.

This is not only the door for agentic enterprise, but also personal assistants and community building.

Download now, it will blow you away.

## Draft 2

This is my take on the perfect AI assistant.

A Rust-based agentic operating system designed to scale for large Slack and Discord communities. The channel is the ambassador to the human. Branches think. Workers execute. Nothing ever blocks.

Meet Spacebot 🟣

The biggest issue with OpenClaw is when it's doing work, it can't talk to you. Spacebot's architecture fixes this by design the conversation layer never touches tools. It delegates thinking to branches and heavy tasks to workers, so it's always responsive even with 100 people talking at once.

Dump your memory files, notes, documents and chat histories into a folder — Spacebot turns them into structured memories automatically. Eight typed memory categories, graph associations, hybrid search. Not markdown files. Not vibes in a vector database.

Built-in @OpenCode workers for deep coding sessions. Browser automation. Brave web search. Cron jobs. A skill system compatible with your existing OpenClaw skills. And a gorgeous control UI at spacebot.sh.

The cortex oversees the whole system — auditing memories, actioning goals and todos. You teach your Spacebot by talking to it. Structure and speed over config files and markdown.

Self-hosting is a single Rust binary. Or one-click cloud deploy at spacebot.sh.

This is for teams, communities, and personal assistants. It will blow you away.
